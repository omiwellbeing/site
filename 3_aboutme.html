		<p>My name is Barbara and I am a certified counsellor. More than 15 years ago, I was as a community youth leader, where my main focus was creating arts and languages programs to support vulnerable teenagers and adults. During my university years I worked on a project that aimed to integrate university students from disadvantaged backgrounds, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose that allowed young minds to thrive. After obtaining my Bachelor of Arts in Languages, I began working with international groups, teaching them the local language and offering guidance on community integration.</p>

			<h2>Why I became a certified counsellor</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My call to become a counsellor emerged from my role as a teacher; students and colleagues often came to me to share their thoughts, emotions, pain and struggles or challenges. Recognising the need for effective support, I embarked on a journey of professional development, studying various therapeutic approaches tailored to individual needs. </p>

			<h2>My values and believes</h2>
		</header>
		<p>For me, diversity is a unifying force, and equity serves as a reminder of our shared humanity. I firmly believe in honouring and respecting one another, valuing each person's unique experiences and perspectives. Guided by principles of integrity, I envision a brighter future for all.</p>
		<p>In my counselling practice, you will find a safe and non-judgmental space where you can freely express your emotions, navigate challenges, and embark on a journey of personal growth. No matter who you are or where you come from, I will warmly welcome you, ready to provide support that’s considerate and attentive to your unique needs and goals.</p>

			<h2>I can relate</h2>
		</header>
		<p>A few years back, I made the move to Australia. Like anyone starting a new chapter abroad, I 
faced my share of demanding professional, emotional, and family challenges. Amidst these, I also 
had to come to terms with the profound loss of a dear family member, an experience that touched 
me deeply. 
During this time, having the appropriate tools and seeking professional support was essential for 
maintaining my mental well-being. If you recognize that you require professional assistance, know 
that I am here to help.</p>

			<h2>On my day off</h2>
		</header>
		<p>When I have a day off, you'll usually find me out and about – hiking, biking, maybe even trying my 
hand at some beach volleyball. Dancing is definitely on the menu too! I'm also diving into learning 
languages. I am knowledgeable in six languages, and I cherish the transformative power of learning 
a language. There's something downright magical about how language learning lets me connect on 
a whole new level with different cultures. Right now, I'm all in on learning my partner's mother 
tongue – talk about an adventure!  
But hey, enough about me. What's your idea of a perfect day off? What floats your boat and makes 
you feel awesome?</p>
